            <p>As an intern my responsibilities at Bitsvalley ilabs was to cover all aspects of creating web application as per the client requirement. For this required core knowledge about various designing aspects and knowledge about designing tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, etc. </p> 
            <p>and backend Scripting Language like PHP. The main responsibility was to ensure that the web application designed must appeal to the desired target audience and, as a result, catches their attention and also include a working knowledge of different web browsers. While working as web developer also requires continuous interactions with other Front End designers too. During my internship period I mostly worked with front end of web development.</p>
